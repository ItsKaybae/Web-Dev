    <h3>Im in love with you</h3>
    <p>It's the way you say I love you and the way you hold my hand.<br />
There's just so much about you I completely understand.<br />
It's the twinkle in your eye that I only see when you look at me.<br />
It's the warmth of your hands; it sends a shock straight to my feet.<br />
It's how you always amaze me, you surprise me all day long.<br />
This I know is true.<br />
Baby, I'm in love with you!</p>
